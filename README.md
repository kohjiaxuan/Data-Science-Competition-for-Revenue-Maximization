# Data-Science-Competition-for-Revenue-Maximization
Champions for a Data Science Competition under <b>SAS Institute</b> with a team of 4. <br><br>
The project challenged teams to gather novel insights and come up with innovative ways to increase the revenue of a Japanese e-commerce company (Ponpare) based on the existing data they have.  <br><br>
The key is to not only uncover new insights from the data, but also learn to communicate technical findings clearly via a business presentation. This helps in convincing stakeholders to buy-in and successfully implement the proposal, which is crucial in data projects. <br><br>
Full details is in <b>Summarized(15min)_Group3_Presentation.pdf</b>. A quick summary of the data project is given below
<br><br>

## Customer Segmentation via k-means Clustering
We identified two important features (time spent on the e-commerce app/website) and amount spent that helps the company to split the users into 4 different groups. These groups will have different browsing and spending habits which can then be targeted differently by the data models.
